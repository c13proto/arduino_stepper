0.33A phase(specification of motor)
Current Limit =0.33*0.7=0.231[A](1/32 step = 70%)
Vref=Current Limit/2=0.1655[V]

* Max current of DRV8825 is 2.5A
2.4A phase(motor's spec is 2.6A)
2.4*0.7=1.68[A](more current acceptable because current devide setting is 1/2 but need to be careful to chip's heat)
Vref=0.84[V]
